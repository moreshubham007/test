Hi,
Here is our requirement, below I have also attached UI design link (adobe
xd) for your reference.
Overview
This document outlines the requirements, architecture, and implementation
plan for developing an in-house email automation tool. The tool will be
hosted on AWS and will integrate with Microsoft 365 and Google
Workspace to manage over 300 email IDs. It will support campaign-based
email sending, track delivery rates, handle complex follow-up schedules,
manage email templates, implement a global blocking feature, and provide
a comprehensive tagging system. The tool will also include a proper inbox
send setup similar to Outlook for the sales team to manage follow-ups with
clients.
Requirements
Functional Requirements
1. Integration with Email Services
• Connect and manage over 300 Microsoft 365 and
Google Workspace email IDs (including server IDs).
2. Email Campaign Management
• Support campaigns with 100 projects, each having 500
companies and 3 email recipients per company (person
1, person 2, person 3).
• Schedule and send emails as part of a campaign.
• Template management for each project to customize
emails.
• Define and manage follow-up emails with specific dates
and times.
• Allow customizable delay times between emails.
• Implement a global blocking feature to stop emails to
contacts who reply with "Not interested."
3. Tracking and Reporting
• Track email delivery rates and provide reports.
• Monitor reply and other email metrics.
4. IP Management
• Connect multiple IP addresses.
• Ensure each email is sent from a different IP address to
avoid spam filters.
5. Inbox Send Setup
• Establish a proper inbox send setup, similar to Outlook,
for all connected email IDs.
• Enable the sales team to follow up with clients directly
from the system.
6. Tagging System
• Implement a tagging system to organize and categorize
projects, companies, and emails for easy management.
Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability
• System must scale to handle large volumes of emails
and multiple campaigns simultaneously.
2. Security
• Ensure secure connection and authentication for email
services.
• Protect email content and user data.
3. Performance
• Optimize email sending and tracking processes to handle
high loads efficiently.
4. Reliability
• Ensure high availability and reliability of the email
sending service.
Architecture
High-Level Architecture
1. User Interface
• Web-based dashboard for managing email campaigns,
tracking metrics, and configuring settings.
• Integrated email client interface for sales team followups.
2. Backend Services
• Email Campaign Service: Handles the creation,
scheduling, and sending of emails.
• Tracking Service: Monitors email delivery and tracks
relevant metrics.
• IP Management Service: Manages and assigns IP
addresses for sending emails.
• Email Integration Service: Connects with Microsoft 365
and Google Workspace.
• Inbox Management Service: Provides an Outlook-like
email interface for the sales team.
• Template Management Service: Manages email
templates for different projects.
• Tagging Service: Manages tags for organizing projects,
companies, and emails.
3. Database

scheduling information, user data, tags, and tracking
metrics..

Security Considerations
• Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with email
services.
• Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
• Regular security audits and updates to address vulnerabilities.
Performance Optimization
• Use AWS SES for efficient email delivery.
• Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
• Optimize database queries and use indexing for faster access.
Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements,
and implementation plan for the email automation tool. By following this
plan, we aim to develop a robust, scalable, and efficient system for
